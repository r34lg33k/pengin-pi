The security of our users and customers is of the utmost importance to us. We take all reasonable steps to protect the security of our systems and data, including regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please do not disclose it publicly. Instead, please send an email to support@tobupengin.com with a description of the vulnerability, and we will respond as soon as possible.

We ask that any security reports include the following information:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the issue
- The affected version(s) of the software
- Any potential impact or consequences of the vulnerability
- Any additional information that may be helpful in understanding or reproducing the issue

We will make every effort to address any vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. If you have any questions or concerns regarding security, please do not hesitate to contact us at support@tobupengin.com.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We ask that you make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research. We will not take legal action against you as long as you comply with the guidelines in this policy.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the security community for their responsible disclosure and assistance in keeping our systems and users safe.
